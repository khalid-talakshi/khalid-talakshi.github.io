## Error Workflow (Interactive)

### Stage 1: Search Existing

```
/context error for "Cannot read property 'map' of undefined"
  ↓
Agent: "Searching existing errors for similar issues...

Found 1 similar error:
  📄 development/errors/react-errors.md (Line 45)
     ## Error: Cannot read property 'X' of undefined
     Covers: General undefined property access in React
     Frequency: common

Found 2 related errors:
  📄 development/errors/react-errors.md
     ## Error: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined
     ## Error: Undefined is not an object"

### Stage 2: Check Duplication (APPROVAL REQUIRED)

```
Agent: "Options:
  [A] Add as new error to react-errors.md
      (Specific case: 'map' on undefined array)

  [B] Update existing 'Cannot read property X' error
      (Add 'map' as common example)

  [C] Skip (already covered sufficiently)

Which framework/category?
  [1] React (react-errors.md)
  [2] JavaScript (js-errors.md)
  [3] General (common-errors.md)

### Stage 3: Preview (APPROVAL REQUIRED)

```
Agent: "Would update development/errors/react-errors.md:

Current (Line 45):
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
## Error: Cannot read property 'X' of undefined

**Symptom**:
```

TypeError: Cannot read property 'X' of undefined

````

**Cause**: Attempting to access property on undefined/null object.

**Solution**:
1. Add null check before accessing property
2. Use optional chaining (?.)
3. Provide default value

**Code**:
```jsx
// ❌ Before
const value = obj.property

// ✅ After
const value = obj?.property ?? 'default'
````

**Prevention**: Always validate data exists before accessing
**Frequency**: common
**Reference**: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Errors/Cant_access_property
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Proposed update:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Error: Cannot read property 'X' of undefined

**Symptom**:

```
TypeError: Cannot read property 'X' of undefined
TypeError: Cannot read property 'map' of undefined  ← NEW
TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined  ← NEW
```

**Cause**: Attempting to access property on undefined/null object.
Common with array methods (map, filter) when data hasn't loaded. ← NEW

**Solution**:

1. Add null check before accessing property
2. Use optional chaining (?.)
3. Provide default value (especially for arrays) ← UPDATED

**Code**:

```jsx
// ❌ Before
const value = obj.property
const items = data.map(item => item.name)  ← NEW

// ✅ After
const value = obj?.property ?? 'default'
const items = (data || []).map(item => item.name)  ← NEW
// Or with optional chaining:
const items = data?.map(item => item.name) ?? []  ← NEW
```

**Prevention**: Always validate data exists before accessing.
For arrays, provide empty array default. ← UPDATED

**Frequency**: common
**Reference**: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Errors/Cant_access_property

## Common Patterns

### Approval Gates
All operations with `enforce="@critical_rules.approval_gate"` MUST:
1. Show clear preview of what will happen
2. Wait for explicit user input
3. Provide options (yes/no/edit/preview/dry-run)
4. Never proceed without confirmation

### Conflict Resolution
When conflicts detected:
1. Present all options clearly
2. Use letter-based selection (A/B/C)
3. Show impact of each option
4. Allow user to choose resolution

### Previews
All previews should show:
1. What will be created/modified/deleted
2. File sizes (before → after)
3. Line-by-line diffs for updates
4. Validation status (under limits, no broken links)

### Backups
Operations that modify files MUST:
1. Create backup before changes
2. Store in `.tmp/backup/{operation}-{topic}-{timestamp}/`
3. Report backup location
4. Keep backups for rollback
